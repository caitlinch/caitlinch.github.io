29/2/2024	MAST: Phylogenetic inference with mixtures across sites and trees	Systematic Biology	"Hundreds or thousands of loci are now routinely used in modern phylogenomic studies. Concatenation approaches to tree inference assume that there is a single topology for the entire dataset, but different loci may have different evolutionary histories due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), introgression, and/or horizontal gene transfer; even single loci may not be treelike due to recombination. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce an implementation of a multi-tree mixture model that we call mixtures across sites and trees (MAST). We implemented the MAST model in a maximum-likelihood framework in the popular phylogenetic software, IQ-TREE. Simulations show that we can accurately recover the true model parameters, including branch lengths and tree weights for a given set of tree topologies, under a wide range of biologically realistic scenarios. We also show that we can use standard statistical inference approaches to reject a single-tree model when data are simulated under multiple trees (and vice versa)."

27/11/2021	Evolving thermal thresholds explain the distribution of temperature sex reversal in an Australian dragon lizard	Diversity and Distributions	Here we show that sex reversal in the widespread Australian dragon lizard Pogona vitticeps is spatially restricted to the eastern part of the species range. Neither climatic variables during the inferred incubation period nor geographic population genetic structure explain this disjunct distribution of sex reversal. The main source of genetic variation arose from isolation by distance across the species range.

17/2/2021	A test statistic to quantify treelikeness in phylogenetics	bioRxiv	"Most phylogenetic analyses assume that the evolutionary history of an alignment (either that of a single locus, or of multiple concatenated loci) can be described by a single bifurcating tree, the so-called the treelikeness assumption. Treelikeness can be violated by biological events such as recombination, introgression, or incomplete lineage sorting, and by systematic errors in phylogenetic analyses. The incorrect assumption of treelikeness may then mislead phylogenetic inferences. To quantify and test for treelikeness in alignments, we develop and assess a test statistic to quantify treelikeness, which we call the tree proportion."
