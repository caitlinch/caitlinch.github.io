Most phylogenetic analyses assume that the evolutionary history of an alignment 
(either that of a single locus, or of multiple concatenated loci) can be 
described by a single bifurcating tree, the so-called the treelikeness 
assumption. Treelikeness can be violated by biological events such as 
recombination, introgression, or incomplete lineage sorting, and by systematic 
errors in phylogenetic analyses. The incorrect assumption of treelikeness may 
then mislead phylogenetic inferences. To quantify and test for treelikeness in 
alignments, we develop and assess a test statistic to quantify treelikeness, 
which we call the tree proportion.
