### Aim
Species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are particularly 
vulnerable to climate change because a resultant skew in population sex ratio 
can have severe demographic consequences and increase vulnerability to local 
extinction. The Australian central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) has a 
thermosensitive ZZ male/ZW female system of genetic sex determination (GSD). 
High incubation temperatures cause reversal of the ZZ genotype to a viable 
female phenotype. Nest temperatures in the wild are predicted to vary on a 
scale likely to produce heterogeneity in the occurrence of sex reversal, and 
so we predict that sex reversal will correlate positively with inferred 
incubation conditions.

### Location
Mainland Australia.

### Methods
Wild-caught specimens of P. vitticeps vouchered in museum collections and 
collected during targeted field trips were genotypically and phenotypically 
sexed to determine the distribution of sex reversal across the species range. 
To determine whether environmental conditions or genetic structure can explain 
this distribution, we infer the incubation conditions experienced by each 
individual and apply a multi-model inference approach to determine which 
conditions associate with sex reversal. Further, we conduct reduced 
representation sequencing on a subset of specimens to characterize the 
population structure of this broadly distributed species.

### Results
Here we show that sex reversal in this widespread Australian dragon lizard is 
spatially restricted to the eastern part of the species range. Neither climatic 
variables during the inferred incubation period nor geographic population 
genetic structure explain this disjunct distribution of sex reversal. The main 
source of genetic variation arose from isolation by distance across the species 
range.

### Main conclusions
We propose that local genetic adaptation in the temperature threshold for sex 
reversal can counteract the sex-reversing influence of high incubation 
temperatures in P. vitticeps. Our study demonstrates that complex evolutionary 
processes need to be incorporated into modelling biological responses to future 
climate scenarios.
