      computing servers

* __Research Assistant__ (Climate modelling): 11/2017 - 11/2017 
  * _Australian National Wildlife Collection, CSIRO_
  * Duties included: 
      * Used daily climate data and niche modelling software to model 
      incubation temperature for wild specimens of bearded dragon, while 
      accounting for uncertainty in age and location
      * Developed a model for predicting the hatching date and nest location 
      for wild bearded dragon specimens, based on capture location and life 
      stage.
      * Collated over 10 years of research data (lab notebooks, spreadsheets,
      other documents) into machine-readable database to facilitate data 
      analysis
